# Props

## A collection of reusable SwiftUI components

These components largely leverage the styling system of SwiftUI. For example, all of the button Props are implemented as ButtonStyles. To use one, import Props into your project and apply a button style like `Button(...).buttonStyle(HandwrittenButtonStyle())`

The Catalog project under Examples shows all of the Props and some additional third party UI components available in swift packages. These are shown in cards that include the name of the style and provide a code sample for each card.

## Installation

Add Props to your project through Xcode by adding a project with the repository's url.
